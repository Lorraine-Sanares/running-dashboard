# Running Dashboard

Purpose of the project
Strava is good at analysing each run, but is not good at comparing runs or showing progress overtime (e.g how much your pace has improved; overall average, pace per distance types)
I want to see how much Iâ€™ve improved overtime. 

I also want to see what my predicted race performance will be in October based on my current progression trends (apply linear regression model).

Additionally, I want to combine my health data, analyse energy expenditure trends throughout the week so that I can gauge my calorie intake so I can maintain a calorie deficit without feeling hungry.
