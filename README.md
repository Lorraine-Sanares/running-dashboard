# Running Dashboard

Purpose of the project
Strava is good at analysing each run, but is not good at comparing runs or showing progress overtime (e.g how much your pace has improved; overall average, pace per distance types)
I want to see how much Iâ€™ve improved overtime. 

I also want to see what my predicted race performance will be in October based on my current progression trends (apply linear regression model).

Additionally, I want to combine my health data, analyse energy expenditure trends throughout the week so that I can gauge my calorie intake so I can maintain a calorie deficit without feeling hungry. 


#### Purpose of the project
This web application creates a dashboard of running statistics and trends from exported Strava and Apple Health data. By pairng these two datasets together, this app intends to help runners view their performance statistics and progress overtime. The race pace predictor is also a useful tool for runners to view their estimated performance on race days based off their current traninng efforts, and can therefore make adjustments to their training plan.

#### Why I made this application
As a beginner runner, 



By pairing a geographic map of well locations with ternary diagram, this app helps geologists to find out results of gas wells with relationship to formations or rock types. This is a demo of Dash interactive Python framework developed by Plotly.
